Description:

A simulation of a (chaotic) pendulum.


Required packages:

wheel (0.37.1)
numpy (1.23.2)
pygame (2.1.2)
pygame-gui (0.6.4)


Usage:

The nodes of the pendulum may be dragged around using the left mouse button as long as the 
pendulum is stopped. When the "Realease" button is pressed, a numerical solution of the 
Euler-Lagrange equation of motion is used to simulate the dynamics of the system.
